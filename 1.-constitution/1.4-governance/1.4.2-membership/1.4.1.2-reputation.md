# 1.4.1.2 Reputation

Reputation can range from 0 to 2 with 2 being the highest reputation obtainable. Each member starts with a reputation at 1.

Reputation is primarily influenced by:

* the degree by which the democratic character of TBA DAO is supported and fostered
* the degree of activity and implementation in the DAO&#x20;
* the evaluation of external and/or internal clients. The community can also vote with a 2/3rd majority to adjust the reputation of a member.

Reputation influences decisional power. Reputation can never lead to exclusion of the DAO, but can lead to functional and operational isolation.
