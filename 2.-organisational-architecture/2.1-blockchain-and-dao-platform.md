# 2.1 Blockchain & DAO Platform

A lot of debate went into the evaluation of multiple aspects for the choice of the Blockchain platform. No optimal solution exists and trade-offs impose themselves. The table below lists the objectives and aspects TBA DAO needs in order to realise its vision, mission and values.

For the prototype version of TBADAO, for reasons of availability of of-the-shelve solutions and ease of implementation, a choice has been made for Ethereum for the Blockchain platform even if we consider that Ethereum has fundamental flaws in the form of absence of separation of data and computation layers and absence of alignment of interests between block-creators and users (pursuit of fees by block creators impedes an open and free participation for all). Additionally, we consider that Ethereum manifests fundamental denial of decentralisation principles operationally and from the standpoint of governance.
