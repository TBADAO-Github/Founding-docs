# 2.3.2 Tokenisation of Work

The foundational building block for TBA DAO consists of the tokenisation of tasks. A task can range from a consulting contract with a client to a small piece of work. The tokenisation process creates an NFT of the hash of an off-chain document describing the task, the delivery and payment conditions. The creator of the NFT is its owner and has the right to:

* transfer the token
* create and transfer sub-tasks / sub-tokens
