# 1.4.1 Decentralisation Committee

The absolute objective of TBA DAO consists of realising the highest possible level of decentralisation. The following table lists the state of decentralisation of TBA DAO at constitution and forms the basis for continued efforts for further decentralisation.

The decentralisation committee has as mission to monitor and assess the current state of decentralisation of TBA DAO as well as any new developments. If a new development in the constitution, the protocol, the procedures or the architecture reduces the overall level of decentralisation, then the Decentralisation Committee has the power to block the development.
