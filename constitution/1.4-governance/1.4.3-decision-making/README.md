# 1.4.3 Decision-making

All governance decisions are the consequence of the acceptance by the community. In order to avoid overloading governance participants with decision-making, a hierarchy of decision-making delegation to sub-DAOs is used.

Example governance parameters (UNISwap: [https://uniswap.org/blog/uni](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni))\
"\
Initial governance parameters are as follows:

1% of UNI total supply (delegated) to submit a governance proposal

4% of UNI supply required to vote 'yes' to reach quorum

7 day voting period

2 day timelock delay on execution\
